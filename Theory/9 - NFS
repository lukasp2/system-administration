2-1 Explain what the automounter is and how it works.
The automounter automatically mounts file systems at access.

2-2 Explain what an automount map is, and the difference between direct and indirect maps.
The automount map stores information about which mount points to monitor and which filesystems to mount. The content of a direct map is complete for itself, the indirect map is not and requires additional information (such as the new vitual directories pathname) from the master map or the automount command line.

2-3 What is the purpose of an automounter? Why not use static network mounts instead.
Its easier to handle, saves local resources, reduces coupling between remote systems which share filesystems.
