1-2 Answer the following questions (the information can be found in e.g. the RFCs that describe DNS).
a) What is an authoritative name server? What is its role in DNS.
An authoritative name server is a server that does not need to reference other servers to resolve queries.

b) What is the difference between a domain and a zone.
A zone is a part of a domain. The domain liu.se contains ida.liu.se but the zone ida.se does not contain ida.liu.se.

c) What is the difference between a recursive and a non-recursive query in DNS? When is each type of query used.
A recursive DNS query is one which will place all the load on the one server you queried. That server will do all the job of finding what you are looking for. A non-recursive will pass the responibility on to a different server.

d) What is the purpose of delegation in DNS.
Scalability and load distributing.

e) What is a resource record? What does a resource record consist of.
Resource records are used to resolve all DNS queries. It conatins IP information and hostname.

f) DNS messages contain answer, authority and additional sections. What is the purpose of each section.
answer: one bit indicating if the DNS server is authoritative for the queried hostname
authority: indicating the authority for the query.
additional sections: other information relevant to the query (recursion desired, recursion available, response code etc.)

g) How does the DNS protocol indicate if an answer comes from an authoritative name server or not? How does the DNS protocol indicate whether a query is recursive or not.
1. The AA bit is set.
2. The RD bit is set.

h) Explain what glue records are and when they are necessary.
A Glue Record is the IP Address of a name server at a domain name registry, they help resolve DNS servers at a core level. When you change the name of a nameserver, you have to provide the glue record for that nameserver, others trying to access the renamed nameserver would otherwise never find it.

1-3 Which zone in DNS contains PTR records corresponding to IP addresses in the network 10.131.24.64/27? 
10.131.in-addr.arpa

Name some other networks that have PTR records in the same zone. 
10.131.24.64/24 -> 10.131.24.64/32

What is the problem with delegating authority over the DNS records corresponding only to 10.131.24.64/27.
The problem is with delegating zones in smaller chunks than 24 bit prefixes. Solved by classless in-addr.arpa delegation.

1-4 Explain the purpose of classless in-addr.arpa delegation. Explain how it works.
It is a way to delegate on non-octet boundaries for address spaces covering fewer than 256 addresses. It makes it possible to assign IP address spaces in smaller chunks than 24 bit prefixes. Authorities can use CNAMEs to insert subdomains that can then be delegated.

2-1 Use the host tool to answer the following questions.
a) What is the address of informatix.ida.liu.se.
130.236.180.77

b) What is the address of www.ida.liu.se.
130.236.180.77

c) What is the address of liu.se.
130.236.5.66

2-2 Compare the output of host www.ida.liu.se ns3.liu.se and host www.ida.liu.se dns.liu.se and answer the following questions.
a) Why is there no answer in the first query but in the second query.
Im getting an answer in both, so I dont know.

b) Both answers are correct, even though they differ. Explain why.
They both can be correct but different because www.ida.se is within the domain of dns.liu.se but not within the zone of ns3.liu.se.

3-1 Use host to find out which name servers are authoritative for the zone adlibris.se. 
host -a adlibris.se
      ;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
      adlibris.se.		86400	IN	NS	dns02.ports.se.
      adlibris.se.		86400	IN	NS	dns01.dipcon.com.
      adlibris.se.		86400	IN	NS	dns04.ports.net.
      adlibris.se.		86400	IN	NS	dns03.ports.se.

Which organization(s) operate them.
ports.net, dipcon.com

3-2 Use host to list all records in the ida.liu.se zone and wc to count them. How many records are there? If this is temporarily unavailable (181017), go on through the tasks.
It fails, the command would maybe be something like 
host -a -l ida.liu.se | wc -l

3-3 Use host to find out all information you can about the name ida.liu.se (i.e. the name itself, not the contents of the zone). What did you find out? How can you be sure that is all the information that is available.
host -a ida.liu.se:

AAAA: Same as A but for IPv6
MX: Mail exchanger, used to help route email to the email server.
NS: Specifies an authoritative name server for given host.

[a-c].ns.se
sunic.sunset.se
ns[1-4].liu.se
