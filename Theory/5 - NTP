2-1 Explain the concept of "stratum" in a clock hierarchy (e.g. NTP, but also synchronized networks and other clock hierarchies). Why is it necessary to have a hierarchy of clocks rather than just a bunch of reference clocks.
Each level in the clock hierarchy is termed a stratum. The hierarchy is much more scalable and requires less traffic to stratum 0 (a more distributed traffic).

2-2 How large a difference between the reference clock and the system clock does NTP accept and attempt to adjust.
128 ms < diff < 1000 ms

2-3 NTP usually works by speeding up or slowing down the clock, not setting it outright. Why.
More secure and reliable. Every timestamp is guaranteed to occur exactly once.

3-3 Explain the output of ntpq -p.
