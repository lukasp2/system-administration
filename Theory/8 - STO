11-1 Why is RAID 1+0 generally considered more reliable than RAID 0+1.
see this website:
https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/10/raid10-vs-raid01/

I RAID 1+0 there are many groups, even if three disks fail (in the example) RAID 1+0 can still be functional. In RAID 01 there are fewer groups and hence less margin for errors.

11-2 As individual disk sizes grow, RAID-5 is no longer considered useful, and RAID-6 is also rapidly becoming obsolete. Why.
RAID 5 and RAID 6 are similar, but RAID 6 boasts a higher data integrity than RAID 5. Both versions however suffers from lack of performance as of its complexity, and space has been sacrificed in an attempt to improve security.

11-3 What is the point of the file system journal in e.g. ext3.
Journaling eliminates the need for a file system check after an unclean shutdown.

11-4 Explain the purpose of using a volume manager, like LVM.
- Disks can be added/replaced without system downtime.
- Enables backups by snapshots.
- Encrypting multiple partitions with only one password
