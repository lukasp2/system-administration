This is the first step you will have to finish. Without it, you will not have access to the internet and therefore no way of downloading the scripts and files needed to finish the other steps.

1.1. setting the hostnames
 For each machine, go to /etc/hostname and set the hostname of the respecitve machine.
 router: gw
 server: server
 clients: client-1 and client-2

1.2. Go to /etc/hosts and set the address, FQDN, and hostname on all your hosts. 
This is what the file should look like on every machine:
 127.0.0.1  localhost
 10.0.0.1   gw.example.com         gw
 10.0.0.2   server.example.com     server
 10.0.0.3   client-1.example.com   client-1
 10.0.0.4   client-2.example.com   client-2

2. basic network connectivity
You may have different names (not ens3, ens4, lo). Check this by running:
 $ ip address

2.1. write the following in the file /etc/network/interfaces on all machines:
 auto lo
 iface lo inet loopback

 allow-hotplug ens3
 auto ens3
 iface ens3 inet dhcp

 auto ens4 (only for router)
 iface ens4 inet static (only for router)

 address 10.0.0.1 (10.0.0.2 on server, and 10.0.0.3, 10.0.0.4 on client-1 and client-2)
 netmask 255.0.0.0
 broadcast 10.255.255.255
 network 10.0.0.0
 gateway 10.0.0.1 (only for server and clients)

2.2. After interface config run:
 $ ifup ens3
 $ ifup ens4 (only for router)

2.3. This command should show now all interfaces:
 $ ip addr

2.5. Reboot and make sure ...
 1: .. you can ping 10.0.0.1 (the router) from the other machines. 
    $ ping 10.0.0.1
 2: .. your hostnames are correct on all machines (should show gw, server, client-1, etc.)
    $ hostname

3. Resolver: Type this into /etc/resolv.conf on the server
 domain.ida.liu.se
 nameserver 130.236.1.9
 #nameserver 130.236.1.10
 #nameserver 130.236.1.11

#4.1. NAT: run the following commands on the router
 #echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
 #apt-get install iptables-persistent
 #/sbin/iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ens -j MASQUERADE
 #/sbin/iptables -A FORWARD -i ens3 -o ens4 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
 #/sbin/iptables -A FORWARD -i ens4 -o ens3 -j ACCEPT
 #dhclient ens3 -v

4.2 Edit /etc/sysctl.conf on router
 change the line net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0 to net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1. 

.. you should now be able to curl www.google.com from all machines

5. Getting Git (for all machines)
 apt-get -y install git
 git clone <this repo>

.. done.
