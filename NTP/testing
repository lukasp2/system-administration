Now your client and server machines are configured to be time-synced. 

1. (client) Check if the client machineâ€™s time is synchronized with NTP server. 
   The output should ideally show a time offset between the two systems.
 $ ntpdate -q gw

2. (router) You can view the time synchronization queue by running the following command.
   You should be able to see gw.example.som as the time synchronization host/source in the queue.
 $ ntpq -p | grep gw.example.com
